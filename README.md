$\text{\textcolor{red}{b. Goal of the project:}}$ 

<p> ECE Grubhub, a revolutionary meal delivery application like Grubhub allows Rutgers students to order food from their favorite restaurant and have it delivered right on their door in real time! </p>

$\text{\textcolor{red}{c. What problems we are trying to solve:}}$

<p>Coming into college, students are often not familiar with the campus food places, now with our custom app, that is especially catered for our own Rutgers students, students won't face the same problem. Our application was created with the aim to re-create some of Grubhubâ€™s functionalities but make it simpler and convenient for student's to navigate through stores near campus and order from there. Special feature about our app is that it gives students a discount rate whenever they place an order through our app! </p>

<h2> $\text{\textcolor{olive}{How to run our code}}$ </h2>
